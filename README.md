// I need to fix the population of the weather weekly projections.  I keep getting stuck on it. Due to the nature of React and how popular it is, I'm spending most of my time learning how to use it and perfect it.  At this point, I'm accepting that there is still small details to learn about large scale javascript projects, but React is where I need to put most of my focus. 

All I hope for on any of these projects is a passing grade.
